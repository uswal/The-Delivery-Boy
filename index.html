              <h1>POINTERS</h1>
              <p style="margin-top: 30px">
                A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another
                variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any
                variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it
                to store any variable address.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 30px">
                The difficulty we usually have with POINTERS has much to do with
                C's pointer terminology than the actual concept. It is difficult
                to get a grip on Pointers just by listening to a discussion on
                Pointers, therefore to overcome this difficulty the three of us
                as team have come up with an idea to demonstrate the working of
                pointers through a simple game which has been developed keeping
                in mind the idea of replicating the most fundamental and simple
                programming concepts involved in pointers.

        <h1>How are we demonstrating concept of pointers though our game?</h1>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          Our player is acting like a pointer which is pointing towards other
          pointer(ADDRESS) and we are updating its value accordingly. Each
          ADDRESS is also acting like a pointer variable which is pointing to a
          specific PACKAGE_NAME. But since it's a game we can't show the package
          name directly else it won't be fun.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          A sheet will be shown for a breif moment containing ADDRESS and
          PACKAGE_NAME. In that breif moment he has to remember the ADDRESS and
          their corresponding PACKAGE_NAME. Whenever he will visit the address
          he has to choose the correct package from his bag. For correct package
          he will be awarded points but for wrong package points will be also
          deducted. He can also choose "not to deliver" for which he won't be
          getting or loosing any points.

        <h1>Rules in our game!</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          <b>1: </b>There are going to be 5 levels. Each level completion will
          award 1000points. Acing the level will award 1200points.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          <b>2: </b>From level-2 hints option will be available. Using it will
          cost 40points from overall points.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          <b>3: </b> Each correct delivery will award 100points. Each incorrect
          delivery will penalize 30points. Not delivering anything will not
          award or penalize any points.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          <b>4: </b>Player will be stopping for 10secs on each address.
          Selecting the package early will award bonus points. Say, out of 10
          secs he selects the PACKAGE_NAME in 3 secs, so he will be awarded
          (10-3)*10 = 70points(bonus). Exceeding this 10sec time limit will be
          considered as out of schedule which will penalize 20points.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          <b>5: </b>Overall points will be the total points from all the levels
          and bonuses which will be used in ranking player on leaderboard.
